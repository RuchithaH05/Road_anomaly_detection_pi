Real-Time Road Anomaly Detection System
📌 Project Description
This project focuses on the development of an IoT-driven Smart Dashcam designed to detect road anomalies such as potholes and speed bumps in real-time. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4, the system processes live video feed from the road to identify damage, enabling safer navigation and providing data for urban road maintenance, specifically tailored for high-traffic environments like Bengaluru.

🛠️ Hardware Requirements
Processing Unit: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB/8GB RAM)

Camera: Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Wide or 1080p USB Webcam

Power Supply: 5V/3A USB-C Power Adapter (or dedicated Car Charger for field testing)

Storage: 32GB Class 10 MicroSD Card

💻 Software Stack
Operating System: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)

Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: OpenCV (Image Processing), TensorFlow Lite / Tiny-YOLO (Deep Learning Inference), NumPy

Remote Management: SSH (Secure Shell) via Mac Terminal

⚙️ System Configuration & Setup
The system is configured for "Headless" operation, allowing it to be controlled remotely without a monitor.

OS Flashing: Raspberry Pi OS installed via Raspberry Pi Imager v2.0.6.

Network: Pre-configured to connect automatically to a Mobile Hotspot (SSID/Password enabled during flashing).

Remote Access: SSH enabled for wireless development from a laptop.

Localisation: Timezone set to Asia/Kolkata for accurate log timestamping.

🚀 Execution & Deployment
1. Environment Preparation
Once logged into the Pi via SSH, run the following to install dependencies:

2. Manual Execution
To run the detection system manually:

3. Automated Deployment (Production)
To ensure the dashcam starts working the moment the vehicle is powered on, the script is deployed as a Systemd Service:

Create a service file: sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/road_detector.service

Enable and start the service:

📊 Methodology
Data Acquisition: Live frames are captured by the Pi Camera.

Preprocessing: Frames are resized and converted to grayscale/RGB using OpenCV.

Inference: The TensorFlow Lite model analyzes the frames for anomaly patterns.

Logging: Anomalies are logged with a local timestamp for further review.
